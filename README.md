# Face Tracker MQTT System

**A Real-Time Distributed Vision & Control Platform**

## What This Does

Automatically detects and tracks faces in real-time, commanding a servo motor to follow target movement. Built on MQTT for reliability and WebSocket for responsive dashboards.

### Core Components

1. **Vision Node** (Python on PC) - Analyzes video, detects faces, publishes commands
2. **Backend Service** (Python on PC) - MQTT subscriber that relays data via WebSocket  
3. **ESP8266 Controller** (MicroPython) - Receives MQTT commands, actuates servo motor
4. **Web Dashboard** (Browser) - Real-time status and tracking visualization

### Key Feature: Team Isolation

Multiple teams can operate simultaneously on the same broker using isolated MQTT topics.

## System Architecture

```
PC (Vision Node) 
    └─→ MQTT Broker ←─┐
                      ├─→ Backend (WebSocket Relay) → Browser Dashboard
                      └─→ ESP8266 Controller → Servo Motor
```

**Design Principle**: Vision generates intelligence. Hardware uses MQTT for certainty. Browsers use WebSocket for speed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Mosquitto MQTT Broker** (local)
- **MicroPython** on ESP8266
- **Modern Web Browser**

### Step 1: Install & Start MQTT Broker

**Windows**
```powershell
Download Mosquitto from https://mosquitto.org/
mosquitto.exe -v
```

**Linux**
```bash
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
```

### Step 2: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python paho-mqtt websockets asyncio
```

### Step 3: Configure Team ID

Set your unique team identifier (prevents cross-team interference):

```python
TEAM_ID = "team01"
MQTT_TOPIC = f"vision/{TEAM_ID}/movement"
```

### Step 4: Launch Services

**Terminal 1** - Start Backend
```bash
python backend/backend.py
```

**Terminal 2** - Run Vision Node
```bash
python vision-node/vision_node.py
```

**Terminal 3** - Flash & Run ESP8266
```bash
# Flash MicroPython, then execute:
ampy --port COM3 put esp8266/main.py
```

**Browser** - Open Dashboard
```
http://localhost:8000/dashboard/index.html
```

## Topic Convention

| Component | Topic | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Vision Node | `vision/{TEAM_ID}/movement` | **Publishes** face position |
| Backend | `vision/{TEAM_ID}/movement` | **Subscribes** & relays |
| ESP8266 | `vision/{TEAM_ID}/movement` | **Subscribes** & actuates |


### ⚠️ Critical Notice

> **Never use topics from other teams.**
> Always verify that your `TEAM_ID` matches your assigned identifier before running any node.

---

### 🔌 1. Start Backend (WebSocket Relay)

```bash
cd backend
python backend.py
```

---

### 👁️ 2. Run Vision Node (PC)

```bash
cd vision-node
python vision_node.py
```

---

### 🌐 3. Open Dashboard

* Open `dashboard/index.html` in your browser.
* Ensure the WebSocket URL matches your backend configuration:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:9002");
```

---

### 📡 4. Flash ESP8266

* Update the MQTT broker IP to your PC’s **local IP address**.
* Connect the servo signal wire to **GPIO5 (D1)**.
* Run `main.py` using MicroPython.

---

### 💓 Optional: Heartbeat Messages

You can publish node health status to:

```
vision/<team_id>/heartbeat
```

#### Example Payload

```json
{
  "node": "pc",
  "status": "ONLINE",
  "timestamp": 1730000000
}
```

---

This ensures system monitoring and helps detect offline nodes in distributed environments.

## 💡 Best Practices

### 1️⃣ Dead-Zone Thresholds
Prevent servo jitter by ignoring small movements below a threshold:
```python
DEAD_ZONE = 5  # degrees
if abs(current_angle - last_angle) > DEAD_ZONE:
    move_servo(current_angle)
```

### 2️⃣ Message Rate Control
Limit MQTT publish frequency to prevent broker flooding:
```python
# Max 10 Hz (100ms between messages)
PUBLISH_INTERVAL = 0.1  # seconds
if (time.time() - last_publish) > PUBLISH_INTERVAL:
    mqtt_client.publish(topic, payload)
```

### 3️⃣ Servo Smoothing
Apply gradual movement instead of abrupt jumps:
```python
# Move servo in 2-5 degree increments
STEP_SIZE = 3  # degrees per update
while abs(target_angle - current_angle) > STEP_SIZE:
    current_angle += STEP_SIZE if target_angle > current_angle else -STEP_SIZE
    servo.write(current_angle)
    time.sleep(0.05)  # 50ms between steps
```

### 4️⃣ Testing Protocol
✅ Always validate locally before deploying  
✅ Test without mechanical load first  
✅ Monitor MQTT message traffic with `mosquitto_sub`  
✅ Verify WebSocket connectivity in browser console  
✅ Gradual transition to closed-loop control

### 📝 Dependencies

Make sure the following tools and libraries are installed:

### 💻 Software

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Mosquitto MQTT Broker**
* **MicroPython (ESP8266 firmware)**

### 📦 Python Libraries

```bash
pip install opencv-python paho-mqtt websockets
```

* `opencv-python` – Face detection and tracking
* `paho-mqtt` – MQTT communication
* `websockets` – Real-time dashboard communication

---

## 🎯 Features

* ✅ Real-time face detection and tracking
* ✅ Servo motor control via ESP8266
* ✅ Fully distributed architecture
* ✅ MQTT topic isolation (multi-team friendly)
* ✅ Live web dashboard updates
* ✅ Local-only mode (no VPS required)
* ✅ Supports both open-loop and closed-loop tracking

---

## 🏁 System Workflow

```
PC Camera → Face Detection → MQTT Publish → ESP8266 → Servo Movement
                                      ↓
                              Backend → Web Dashboard
```

### 🔹 Phase 1 – Open Loop

* Camera is fixed.
* Face position controls servo directly.

### 🔹 Phase 2 – Closed Loop

* Camera mounted on servo.
* Continuous feedback enables dynamic tracking.

## ⚠️ Architecture Rules

To maintain clean system separation:

* ❌ Avoid direct PC ↔ ESP connections
* ❌ Avoid direct Dashboard ↔ MQTT connections
* ✅ All communication must flow through defined backend services
